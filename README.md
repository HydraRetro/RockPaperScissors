# RockPaperScissors
Rock, Paper, Scissors - TOP Project

Day 1: 
- Figured out of how play the game a single time using if/else nested statements. 
- Computer randomly picks an integer between 0-2 and returns one of the three values assigned.

Day 2: 
- Filled in day 1 readme. 
- Cleaned up game function to be slightly less messy by using || and &&. 
- Eliminated the repeated TIE GAME bringing it just one. 
- It took much longer than I want to admit to loop the game 5 times. 
- Added scores to player and computer but stuck on how to return the winner.
- Added Tailwind CSS and built a basic page to start.
- Finally figured out how to return a winner and all I needed to do was call the function I made for it..I feel silly.
- Added cute github svg icon to my github.
- Over all it took a few hours to just do this. Okay, more than a few hours but im trying to keep a fire lit and the wood is wet.
